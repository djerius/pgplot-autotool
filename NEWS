5.2.2-9

  [BUG FIX]

    * On MacOS with homebrew, the homebrew provided gfortran does not
      search the homebrew lib dirs for the X11 libraries, while the system
      clang does, so the latter could find them, but the former couldn't.


    * Linking is failing on some Windows systems due to mismatch between
      Fortran and C naming conventions.  Attempted fix applied.


5.2.2-8

  [BUG FIX]

    * pkg-config files specified out-of-order Fortran libraries which
      cause links to fail on systems which perform single pass symbol
      resolution.

5.2.2-7

  [BUILD FIXES]

    * now builds on Windows (msys2). zmughal++
    * add support for finding X flags using pkg-config which helps
      with some installations of macOS. zmughal++

  [CI]

    * GitHub actions set up to test on Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows (msys). zmughal++

5.2.2-6

  [BUILD FIXES]

    * Add -std=legacy to AM_FFLAGS if GNU Fortran is used, as more modern
      versions of Fortran won't compile the code.

    * Check that the requisite X headers are installed if X drivers
      are requested. If not, warn and don't try to compile the
      affected drivers.

5.2.2-5

  [BUILD FIXES]

    * don't attempt to compile X Window System drivers if no OS support
      for X is available

    * replace K&R forward declarations with ANSI prototypes; fix
      discovered mis-calls to pgdispd/getcolors

    * On some systems (older OS X) (older) gfortran defaulted to building
      32 bit objects; auto-detect this and force 64bit builds

  [BUILD FIXES]

    * fix to pkg-config file
